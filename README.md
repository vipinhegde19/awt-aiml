#  Lab Programs 

## Hey Classmates! 👋

Welcome to this collection of lab programs! Feel free to use these as a reference while you're working on your own assignments. It's all here to help you understand the concepts better and get through those tricky bits.

## A Friendly Reminder 😊

This repo is just for **reference**—please don't copy everything directly! Plagiarism isn't cool, and it's always better to learn by doing. Use these programs to get ideas, understand how things work, and then write your own code.

## Use with Caution ⚠️

Remember, this is all provided "as-is." We’ve done our best to keep everything accurate, but if something doesn’t work or isn’t quite right, it’s on you to figure it out. So, use these resources wisely!

## In Short:
- **Learn from this repo**, don’t just copy-paste.
- **Double-check everything** before you submit it.
- **No guarantees**—you’re on your own if something goes wrong.

## Happy Coding! 💻

Got questions or need help? Just reach out—this is a team effort after all!
